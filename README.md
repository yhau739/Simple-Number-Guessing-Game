# Simple-Number-Guessing-Game
**The Number Guessing Game** is a beginner-level project written in python 3.

<font size="4"> How to Play?</font> 
In this game, a player must simply guess a random integer generated by the programme that is between (1-100). The system will keep track of the number of guesses made by a player and display them when the number is correctly guessed. Players can simply compare their guesses to determine their score. The **fewer** the guesses, the **higher** a player's score.

##Lessons learned
I learned a lot while working on my first beginner project. From "While Loops" and "If Else Statements" to using Python libraries such as "system" and "random".
